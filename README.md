# About this project

This is the backend for a collaborative RSS reader. It's a project I'm developing in my free time as a way to learn the Mongo / Express / React / Node stack.

I recently discovered several best practices I'm not following, so there will be some heavy refactoring as time permits.

I'm also still researching testing frameworks, so there aren't any of those yet.
